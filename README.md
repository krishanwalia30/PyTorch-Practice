## PyTorch-Practice
This repository contains all the efforts made into learning PyTorch and its usage in terms of DeepLearning. PyTorch allows the users to create Neural networks using Python easily and quickly.


### Topics covered in this repository
The topics that has been worked out in this repository are:

- Understanding and working with Torch Tensors.
- Understanding and implementing Back Propagation in DeepLearning,
- Creation of Artificial Neural Networks using Pytorch.
- Word embedding for categorical features in the dataset.
- Creation of a Feed Forward Neural Network using Pytorch.
- Using the curated FNN for Advanced House Price Prediction dataset.


### ðŸ’» Important Code snippet(s)
